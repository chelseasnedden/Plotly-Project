# Plot.ly Project - Belly Button Microbe Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this assignment, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The following steps are the directions I was given.

## Step 1: Plotly Integration

1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Used `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Used `sample_values` for the y values.

* Used `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

* Used `otu_labels` for the text values.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Updated all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected. An example dashboard is shown below:

## Deployment

I have deployed the assignment to GitHub Pages. The link to my Github Page is here: [Belly Button Dashboard](https://chelseasnedden.github.io/Plotly-Project/)
